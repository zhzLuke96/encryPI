# Encrypt in π
encryπ! Put your files in π! ? This tool can encrypt your files into PI! And quickly recover your encrypted information.

However, cost is obvious, you need at least twice the space of the source file to store your encrypted content...

but, this idea is very interesting, isn't it? you can check out the [project(pifs)](https://github.com/philipl/pifs).

# π
PI is a magic number, it seems to be a combination, contains unlimited possibilities(decimal part), and can even be used as a random number generator. But no one can prove it

> However, here we have by default it has been proven, because at least before 1 billion, it seems to be desirable<br>
> `Combined：a number containing all combinations of numbers, called the "combined number"`

> 加密的压缩率很惊人，几乎两倍于源文件，也许可以找到更好的方法改造一下？
